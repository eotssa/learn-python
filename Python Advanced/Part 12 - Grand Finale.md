### **Programming Exercise: Hockey Statistics**
---

**Introduction:**
In this exercise, you will create an application to examine hockey league statistics from the NHL for the 2019-20 season. 

---

**File Structure:**

- **partial.json**: Contains a subset of the data for testing purposes.
  
- **all.json**: Contains all the NHL player stats for the 2019-20 season.
  
Each player entry has the following format:
```json
{
    "name": "Patrik Laine",
    "nationality": "FIN",
    "assists": 35,
    "goals": 28,
    "penalties": 22,
    "team": "WPG",
    "games": 68
}
```

---

**Functionalities:**

1. **File Input**:
   * Ask the user for the filename (`partial.json` or `all.json`).
   * Load the JSON data from the file.

2. **Main Menu**:
   * Display the following commands to the user:
     - `0`: quit
     - `1`: search for a player
     - `2`: teams
     - `3`: countries
     - `4`: players in team
     - `5`: players from country
     - `6`: most points
     - `7`: most goals
   * Wait for user input to select a command.

3. **Search by Name**:
   * Allow the user to search for a player by their name.
   * Display the player's stats in the specified format.

4. **List Teams**:
   * Display all the team abbreviations in alphabetical order.

5. **List Countries**:
   * Display all the country abbreviations in alphabetical order.

6. **List Players by Points**:
   * List players in a specific team, ordered by points (highest to lowest).

7. **List Players by Country**:
   * List players from a specific country, ordered by points (highest to lowest).

8. **Most Successful Players by Points**:
   * List `n` players who've scored the most points.
   * If two players have the same score, order by number of goals (higher number first).

9. **Most Successful Players by Goals**:
   * List `n` players who've scored the most goals.
   * If two players have the same number of goals, order by the number of games played (lower number first).

---

**Formatting**:

The printout format for a player must be as follows:
```
Leon Draisaitl       EDM  43 + 67 = 110
```
- The abbreviation for the team starts at the 22nd character.
- The `+` sign is the 30th character.
- The `=` sign is the 35th character.
- All fields should be right-justified with space characters.
  
Use f-strings for formatting the output.

**Solution Space**:
```python
# Start by importing the necessary libraries
import json

# Define functions for each of the functionalities mentioned above

# 1. File Input Function:
def load_data(filename: str) -> list:
    pass

# 2. Main Menu Function:
def display_menu() -> None:
    pass

# 3. Search by Name Function:
def search_by_name(players: list, name: str) -> None:
    pass

# 4. List Teams Function:
def list_teams(players: list) -> None:
    pass

# 5. List Countries Function:
def list_countries(players: list) -> None:
    pass

# 6. List Players by Points Function:
def list_players_by_team(players: list, team: str) -> None:
    pass

# 7. List Players by Country Function:
def list_players_by_country(players: list, country: str) -> None:
    pass

# 8. Most Successful Players by Points Function:
def most_points(players: list, n: int) -> None:
    pass

# 9. Most Successful Players by Goals Function:
def most_goals(players: list, n: int) -> None:
    pass

# Main function that ties all the functionalities together and provides interactivity:
def main():
    pass

# Call the main function to run the program:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
