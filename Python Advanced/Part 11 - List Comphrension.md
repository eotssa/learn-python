1. **Basic List Comprehension**:
   List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. The basic structure is:
   ```python
   [expression for item in iterable]
   ```

2. **Using Conditionals**:
   You can include `if` and `else` statements within a list comprehension. Here's an example of using an `if` statement:
   ```python
   [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
   ```
   And with `if-else`:
   ```python
   [x if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in range(10)]
   ```

3. **Nested List Comprehensions**:
   You can also have nested list comprehensions. Here's an example:
   ```python
   [[y for y in range(3)] for x in range(3)]
   ```

4. **Using Multiple Iterables**:
   You can iterate over multiple iterables as well:
   ```python
   [(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in [3, 1, 4] if x != y]
   ```

5. **Dictionary Comprehensions**:
   Not only lists, but you can also create dictionaries using comprehension:
   ```python
   {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
   ```

6. **Set Comprehensions**:
   Similar to lists and dictionaries, you can create sets using comprehension:
   ```python
   {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
   ```

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   List comprehensions often provide a more readable and compact syntax, and they can be more efficient than equivalent loops.

3. **Using Ternary Expression**: You can use a ternary expression to choose between two values based on a condition.

   ```python
   even_odd_squares = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x**3 for x in range(10)]
   ```

4. **Nested List Comprehension**: You can nest list comprehensions for more complex operations.

   ```python
   matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
   flattened = [item for sublist in matrix for item in sublist]
   ```

5. **Combining Multiple Lists**: You can iterate through multiple lists simultaneously.

   ```python
   sum_list = [a + b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
   ```

6. **Using Functions in List Comprehension**: You can also call functions within a list comprehension.

   ```python
   def transform(x):
       return x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x**3

   transformed_numbers = [transform(x) for x in range(10)]
   ```
