# Variable Scope in Python

The scope of a variable refers to the sections of a program where a variable is accessible. In Python, variables can have local or global scope.

## Local Variables

Variables defined within a function have local scope, meaning they are only accessible within that function. This includes function parameters and other variables defined within the function. Local variables do not exist outside the function.

In the following example, the variable `x` is defined within the `testing` function:

```python
def testing():
    x = 5
    print(x)

testing()
print(x)  # Raises a NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

Here, `x` is only accessible within the `testing` function. Trying to access `x` outside the function results in an error.

## Global Variables

Variables defined outside any function, typically in the main section of the program, have global scope. Global variables can be accessed from any part of the program, including other functions.

```python
def testing():
    print(x)

x = 3
testing()  # Outputs 3
```

In this example, `x` is a global variable defined in the main section of the program. It can be accessed and used within the `testing` function.

However, a global variable cannot be changed directly from within a function unless specified using the `global` keyword:

```python
def testing():
    x = 5
    print(x)

x = 3
testing()  # Outputs 5
print(x)   # Outputs 3
```

Here, the `testing` function creates a new local variable `x` that masks the global variable. The local variable `x` has a value of 5, but it is a separate variable from the global `x`.

To modify the global variable within a function, you need to use the `global` keyword:

```python
def testing():
    global x
    x = 3
    print(x)

x = 5
testing()  # Outputs 3
print(x)   # Outputs 3
```

By using `global x` within the `testing` function, the assignment `x = 3` affects the global variable `x` as well.

## When to Use Global Variables

Global variables should be used judiciously and not as a way to bypass function parameters or return values. It is generally better to use function parameters and return values to pass data between functions.

Global variables are useful in situations where you need to have common information available to multiple functions throughout the program. For example:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    global count
    count += 1
    return a + b

def calculate_difference(a, b):
    global count
    count += 1
    return a - b

count = 0
print(calculate_sum(2, 3))         # Outputs 5
print(calculate_sum(5, 5))         # Outputs 10
print(calculate_difference(5, 2))  # Outputs 3
print(calculate_sum(1, 0))         # Outputs 1
print("There were", count, "function calls")  # Outputs "There were 4 function calls"
```

Here, the global variable `count` keeps track of how many times the functions `calculate_sum` and `calculate_difference` are called.

However, it's important to use global variables sparingly and consider other alternatives, such as function parameters and return values, whenever possible. Overusing global variables can make it difficult to track program state and lead to unpredictable behavior.

Passing data between functions is best achieved through function arguments and return values, as shown in the example below
